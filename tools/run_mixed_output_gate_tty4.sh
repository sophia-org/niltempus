# and core.kdl, mixed_output_probe.kdl and the DRM-master guard are read from
# that staged tree; this repository is bound too; the TTY comes from
# SOPHIA_SESSION_TTY or the controlling terminal; absolute SOPHIA_BIN and

usage: run_mixed_output_gate_tty4.sh [--optimize-for=HEAD]

  --optimize-for=HEAD  How the mirror group picks its logical size. HEAD is a
                       connector ($MIRROR_PRIMARY or $MIRROR_MEMBER), the words
                       "primary" or "member", or "center-unscaled" (either
                       spelling). Naming a head makes that one pixel-exact and
                       the other reaches the group's size by resampling, so it
                       looks softer. center-unscaled sizes the group to fit
                       inside both, so neither resamples and a head with room
                       left over shows a border instead. The extended head
                       $EXTENDED is always native and cannot be chosen.
                       Defaults to $MIRROR_PRIMARY.

Every connector and label is also overridable by environment variable; see the
SOPHIA_MIXED_* assignments at the top of this script.
