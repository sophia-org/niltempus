Usage: tools/run_sophia_input_latency_tty3.sh

Run from a logged-in local TTY3 with DRM released and /dev/uinput writable.
Pass --shared to measure with a card's outputs sharing one renderer thread.
--direct is refused here: this harness's client is xterm, which draws through
X core rendering and never presents a DMA-BUF, so direct scanout cannot
engage. Use the standalone GPU-client profile for that.
The default gate collects 35 independent sessions. Their presses pool into
one population, and the reporter refuses to call anything a ninety-ninth
percentile below two hundred of them. It requires p99 below two refresh
periods against the refresh each session recorded, and separately caps queue
dwell at 1 ms with dwell-to-submit and submit-to-flip each within one
refresh. Override the session count, refresh period, or stage budgets with
the SOPHIA_INPUT_LATENCY_* environment variables.
