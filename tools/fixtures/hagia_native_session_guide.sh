# The native-session guide. It drives the bounded product workflow that
# `todo.md` puts on the critical path -- three terminal launches, a visible
# focus-next, one close, and a normal logout -- through Sophia's own WM and
# shell protocols.
#
# It runs inside the startup Kitty and advances only on committed telemetry, so
# every screen the operator sees corresponds to a fact Sophia recorded rather
# than to elapsed time.

# Only the startup terminal is the guide. One application id carries one
# argument list, and the terminal the launch action spawns must be that same
# application -- a normal session refuses a physical text proof whose terminal
# action names anything but its single startup application. So every terminal
# this workflow launches also runs this script, and every instance after the
# first stands down into an ordinary shell. Without this, each new window ran a
# second guide, found its waits already satisfied, exited, and took the window
# with it, because a terminal exits when its command does.
